# Functional thinking in Javascript, 1/18/2018, Mike Labriola

* First class functions
* Higher order functions
* What to do, not how
* Testing
* Closures
* Currying

    Breaking up the arguments:
    const add = (x,y) => x+y;
    const add = x => y = x+y;  // curried

* Partial application
* Memoization
