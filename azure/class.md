Azure Monitor Keeps logs for only 30 days You can query the logs in a
SQL-like language.

The alerts functionality is going to probably obviate our Nagios
monitoring.  Then again, each alert costs real money, so maybe not.

The monitoring intercepts HTTP requests and can monitor for you.  So if
you've got Tomcat running, alerts will tell if Tomcat returns a 404,
without Tomcat doing the logging.

Network Watcher has to be set up on a per-datacenter basis.
