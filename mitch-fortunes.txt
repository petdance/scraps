   I was in downtown Boise Idaho and I saw a duck. I knew the duck was lost,
   because ducks aren't supposed to be downtown. There's nothing for 'em
   there. So I went to a Subway sandwich shop. I said, "Let me have a bun."
   She wouldn't sell me just the bun, she said it had to have something on
   it. She said it's against Subway regulations to sell just the bun. I guess
   the two halves aren't supposed to touch. So, I said, "All right, put some
   lettuce on it." "That'll be $1.75!" I said, "It's for a duck!" "Oh, then
   it's free." I did not know that. Ducks eat for free at Subway! Had I known

   fajita sub, and don't bother ringing it up - it's for a duck! There are

   I find that a duck's opinion of me is influenced by whether or not I have
   bread. A duck loves bread, but he does not have the capability to buy a
   loaf. That's the biggest joke on the duck ever. If I worked at a
   convenience store, and a duck came in and stole a loaf of bread, I would
   let him go. I'd say, "Come back tomorrow, bring your friends!" When I
   think of a duck's friends, I think of other ducks. But he could have, say,
   a beaver in tow.
