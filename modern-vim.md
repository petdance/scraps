p. vii

"I didnâ€™t choose this notation without good reason." would be much
clearer as "I chose this notation for a good reason."


p. 3
In vim8, I went to build all my help tags

    :helptags ALL

It came back with:

    E152: Cannot open /usr/local/vim8/share/vim/vim80/doc/tags

I had just made a fresh install of vim8 and root owns that tags file.
I `chmod`ded it and all was well.

I didn't test this tip under Neovim because the pathing is all different.

You said that you created a package called `bundle`, but I think that
will be confusing to people (like me) who already know "bundle" as a
directory name to put bundles in.  As a vim 7.4+pathogen user, all my
packages are in `~/.vim/bundle`.

I think you need to explicitly explain what a package is.  Unless I
look at `:help packages`, I don't know that a package is a directory
that groups plugins.  Is there any more to a package than just being
a directory?
